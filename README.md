# Sample Node.js application

This repository is a sample Node.js application for Docker's documentation.
This particular project is pushed to the docker hub and if you want to pull it : vasudha301/todoapp:tagname
The application is basic to-do app but I have created this in order to have a good understanding of what is docker and how it works.
